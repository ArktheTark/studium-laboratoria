- focus css selector for input
- shorthand outline property
- margin auto inside flex container
- flask basics
- forms
- FormData object
- dotenv
- autocomplete attribute
  stringify
- jsonify (python)
- originally I was doing this, but when sending to a flask backend, sending just the object is completely fine. Using stringify will not let flask read the request data properly.

- autocomplete attribute
- event.preventDefault()
- submit event :
- when you use the submit event with the 'eventListener()' function, you need to make sure you are adding the listener to the Form and NOT the submit button
